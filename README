If you want to run experiments, adjust the config in run_all_models.py and execute it:
python run_all_models.py

/util is the folder containing other codes: preprocessing, t-SNE visualization
/log is the folder containing log documents (I didn't upload it)
/data is the folder containing raw data, final processed data, and metadata summary (I didn't include the data file for privacy and space consideration)
